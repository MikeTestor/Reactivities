Hi there! 

This project is build from the Udemy course Complete guide to building an app with .Net Core and React
from Neil Cummings.

[https://aryza.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react](https://aryza.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react)


I've used this as a training to sharpen my knowledge on Asp.net and React. A lot of subjects that are used in 'real-world' projects are in the course, for example databases and entity framework, as well as Signal R. 

I made notes for all of these (and maby more) subjects. Those notes are avaiable as .md files in the *Learning* subdirectory.
